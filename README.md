# cobicaduarte16

**A guide to install and use**



We start by compiling the files using:

python3 compile.py path_to_files

for example:

python3 compile.py PAN16

such that PAN16 is a folder which contains all the files and resides in the same path of the files compile.py

This step works on convert the files from .xml format to .txt format.
