# cobicaduarte16

**First step**



We start by compiling the files using:

		python3 compile.py path_to_files

for example:

		python3 compile.py PAN16

such that PAN16 is a folder which contains all the files and resides in the same path of the files compile.py

This step works on convert the files from .xml format to .txt format.


**Second step**

		javac ReplaceSpecialStrings.java

		java ReplaceSpecialStrings

Which will take the txt files generated by the first step and tag them using special tags as explained in the paper.

For example @username will be replaced by _MENTION_TAG.

**Third step**

		python3 training.py ./tagged_dataset/ path_to_truth_file

This step will get the tagged files produced by the second step as an input and train a model and produce a .pkl model file.
the training phase makes use from the preparing module.

After finishing this phase we get a .pkl model file which will be used later in the testing pahse.

**Fourth step**
