# cobicaduarte16

**First step**



We start by compiling the files using:

python3 compile.py path_to_files

for example:

python3 compile.py PAN16

such that PAN16 is a folder which contains all the files and resides in the same path of the files compile.py

This step works on convert the files from .xml format to .txt format.


**Second step**

javac ReplaceSpecialStrings.java

java ReplaceSpecialStrings

Which will take the txt files generated by the first step and tag them using special tags as explained in the paper.

For example @username will be replaced by _MENTION_TAG.

**Third step**
